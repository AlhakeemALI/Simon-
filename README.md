`SIMON GAME`

## Description

My app is called Simon. It's a web app version of the Digital Simon game. The program chooses a sequence of colors and makes the player repeat the same sequence to advance to the next round, with the sequence getting more difficult to follow in every round.The player's score from every round adds up as the game progresses. Users will have the option to play again.

#### How to play:

Click 'start' and the game makes choosing a number of colors, the number of colors chosen for every round is determined by the round number. When the game finishes making its choices. the player has to repeat the same sequence before advancing to the next round, if the player failed to guess the right sequence a message will display
"Your choices were wrong Select the Reset button to start over!!"

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound as each color gets clicked to help me to better follow the sequence

* As a player I would like to hear different sounds for each color so I can keep track of the sequence incase I look away and don't see when a color glows.
* As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a win or loss.
* As a player, I want to know when I have lost the game
* As a player, I want to be able to click a start button so that the sequence I have to repeat only starts when I am ready to play
* As a player, I would like to know what round I am in, incase I lose track

#### Stretch Goals:

As a player I would like to add a new feature where the user can type a name and it shows all past results with scores.
